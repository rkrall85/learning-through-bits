HW 4: Conditionals and Loops                               15 points

Write a program that asks the user for an integer representing a year. Only a year on or after 1582 must be allowed â€“ this is the year that the Gregorian calendar was adopted. Any year less than this should result in an error message followed by asking the user to re-enter a more appropriate value.

Your program will then determine whether the year input by the user is a leap year (or not) in the Gregorian calendar. Note that a leap year has 29 days in February.

The rules for determining a leap year can be found at: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/214019/method-to-determine-whether-a-year-is-a-leap-year

To determine whether a year is a leap year, follow these steps (excerpted from link above):

If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
If the year is evenly divisible by 100, go to step 3. Otherwise, go to step 4.
If the year is evenly divisible by 400, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).
Allow the user to evaluate multiple years. The user may terminate the program using an appropriate sentinel value.

Place your code in a file named main.py and check it into Canvas.
