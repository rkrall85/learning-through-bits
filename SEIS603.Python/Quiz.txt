Difference between formal and informed language:
    In mathematics, computer science, and linguistics,
        a formal language is a set of strings of symbols together
        with a set of rules that are specific to it. ...
        A formal language is often defined by means of a formal grammar
        such as a regular grammar or context-free grammar,
        also called its formation rule.
    Informal language is pseudocode.



Hardest error to find:
    Semantic. Might not show up for years
Difference between low level and high level languages:
    Ultimately, programs written in a high-level language must be translated
        into machine language by a compiler or interpreter.
        The first high-level programming languages were designed in the 1950s.
        Now there are dozens of different languages,
        including Ada, Algol, BASIC, COBOL, C, C++, FORTRAN, LISP, Pascal, and Prolog.

    Low-level languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter—
        second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor
        called an assembler— and the resulting code runs directly on the processor.

What's wrong with code: Never casted the string to an int.
