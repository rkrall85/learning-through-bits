A file (input.txt) has student entries of the form (lastname-firstname-score-totalpoints)
Doe-John-100-100
Doe-Jane-85-100
Smith-Andrew-75-100
Winglow-James-60-100

Read in this file and compute the percentage points scored, and convert it to a letter grade as follows:

> 90%, A
>= 80% but <90%, B
>= 70% but <80%, C
<70%,  F

Write the resulting rows to a new file (output.txt) with the form:
Doe-John-100-100-A
Doe-Jane-85-100-B
Smith-Andrew-75-100-C
Winglow-James-60-100-F

Name your source file: grades.py, your input file input.txt, and your output file output.txt.

Canvas does not permit uploading of multiple files, so either:

zip your grades.py, input.txt, and output.txt into a single .zip archive (do not use a different compression format), or
upload just your grades.py to this question, and email your input.txt and output.txt files to me separately.
Note: solve ONLY 1 out of the 2 questions. You will not get extra credit if you solve both.
