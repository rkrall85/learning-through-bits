Problem 1: 25 points

Design and implement a program that prints the number of odd, even, and 0 digits in an integer value that it reads from the keyboard.

If the user inputs the integer 120675, then your program should print out: odd: 3, even: 2, and zero: 1

Note: solve any 2 out of the 3 questions. You will not get extra credit if you solve all 3.

Problem 2: 25 points

Write a program that prompts for the numerator and denominator of a fraction as integers, and then prints the decimal equivalent of the fraction. Print only up to 2 decimal places in the fractional part. Ensure that your program does not fail if the user enters a denominator of 0.

If the user enters a numerator of 1 and a denominator of 3, then your program would print 0.33.

Note: solve any 2 out of the 3 questions. You will not get extra credit if you solve all 3.

Problem 3: 25 points

Write a program that prompts for the user's first name and last name (separately). Then print a string composed of the first letter of the user's first name followed by the first five characters of the user's last name followed by a random number in the range 10 to 99. Ensure that your program does not fail if the user enters a last name that is less than 5 letters long.

Such algorithms are sometimes used to generate usernames for new computer accounts.

If the user were to enter John Smith, then your program would generate an username in the range jsmith10 to jsmith99.

Note: solve any 2 out of the 3 questions. You will not get extra credit if you solve all 3.
