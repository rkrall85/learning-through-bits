difference between low and high level: speed
difference between formal and informal language: one is by a committee and other is not.



5 common things in a programming language
1. input            input
2. output           print
3. process          data types
4. conditional      data in memory; user enter his age and based on his age to sell him R rated movie tickets (if statements)
5. repetition       while loops

Input --> Process --> Output


2 modes of python: shell mode and program mode
  additional modes are interactive python(shell) and jupyter notebooks


IDE has
  1. editor
    a. color schema
    b. errors
    c. syntax highlighting
  2. debugger
  3. interpretor

types of modules
1. data modules
  a. an object of a python class must first be initiated - an instance
  b. each instance has
    - associated state (data members) (turtle or screen)
    - methods that can be invoked(behaviors)
  --import turtle
2. Utility modules
  a. instance need not be constructed before methods are invoked
  b. but no individual state is possible
  --import math


types of values
1. scalars
  - int, float, bool, etc. that are associated with only a single values
2. Collections
  - value is made up a smaller components
      - str is made of individual chars: 1- char strings
      - sequential order from left to right
  - a colleciton data type can be treated as a signle entity
  or
  - we can access its component parts using
    - index operator []
    - and a integer index
    example
      name = "John Smith"
      print(name[0])
      print(name[-1])

Collection types
1. lists
   - sequential ordered collection of values
   - names = [1,2,3,4]
2. Ranges
  - delivers a sequence of values
  - range(start, end, step)
3. repetition / Iteration
  - is a compound statement that consists of
      - header line with
        - the for keyword
        - a loop variable
        - the in keyword
        - a colon
        - example is a for or while loop
      - body of 1+ indented statements (a block)
        - executed for each iteration
