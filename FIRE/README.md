# Fire Reports


### HeatMaps

We have different types of HeatMaps.  The code is located [here](HeatMaps).

### Various Reports

# Fire Calculations 


### Rate of Return 

This is the calc we use for Rate of Return.  This seems like the most accurate for the data being collected currently.

```

market_gains = ('Ending Balance' - 'Total Contributions' - 'Initial Balance' - 'Initial Roll Over' - 'Starting Balance')
rate_of_return = market_gains / 'Ending Balance'

```

### Compound Annual Growth Rate

One of the calculations we do to track the FIRE progress is the CAGR <i>(Compound Annual Growth Rate)</i>. <br/>
Here is the formula is in the simplest terms.  We modified it a little to account for Roll Over Contributions to get an accurate measure. <br>

```python
((BV / EV)**(1/n)-1)Ã—100
```

```markdown
EV = Ending Value
BV = Beginning Value
n = Number of Years
```
